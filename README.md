## üìú Project Description

This website serves as a dynamic portal to the world of Harry Potter, fetching and displaying detailed information about the books, characters, houses, and spells. The goal was to create not just an informational site, but a magical experience, complete with ambient music, themed visuals, and interactive elements that make the user feel like they are casting spells and exploring the castle themselves.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Fully Responsive Design:** A seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Dynamic Content:** All information for Books, Characters, Houses, and Spells is loaded dynamically from a dedicated API.
* **Immersive Atmosphere:**
    * A full-screen video background on the homepage.
    * Persistent background music with a sound toggle, remembering your choice across pages.
    * A custom mouse cursor that leaves a trail of wand sparkles.

## ‚ú® How to Use the Magic (Easter Egg Guide)

This site is filled with hidden magic! Here‚Äôs how to find it:

* üîÆ **Polyjuice Potion:** See that potion bottle (`üß™`) in the bottom-left corner? Click it **three times** to transform the website's theme into that of another character. Click again to cycle through or reset.

* üí° **Lumos & Nox:** Need some light? Just type `lumos` on your keyboard to illuminate the area around your cursor. Type `nox` to turn the light off.

* üé© **The Sorting Ceremony:** Are you brave, wise, loyal, or ambitious? Type `sortme` on your keyboard (or click the hat icon in the bottom-right on mobile) to take the Sorting Hat quiz and be sorted into your Hogwarts house, which will change the site's theme to match!

* üåü **The Golden Snitch:** Be quick! A Golden Snitch will occasionally fly across the screen. Click it before it disappears to catch it!
